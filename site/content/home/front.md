Welcome to the portal for the **Systems Biology Markup Language** (**SBML**), a free and open data format for computational systems biology that's used by thousands of people worldwide.  Here you can find out more about SBML, compatible software, upcoming events, and more.

    <strong>What <em>is</em> SBML?</strong><br>
    SBML is a software data format for describing models in biology.  It's a little like HTML, but for [formal models instead of web pages](documents/what-is-sbml/).  It's independent of any particular software tool and not limited to any particular field of the life sciences.  It's open and free.

    <strong>How do you use it?</strong><br>
    Many software tools and databases support SBML directly.  You don't write in SBML yourself&mdash;your software does it for you.  The <a href="facilities/showcase">SBML Showcase</a> can yelp you find SBML-compatible software, and the <a href="https://biomodels.net">BioModels Database</a> can help you find published models.

    <strong>How can you support SBML in your own software?</strong><br>
    If you're developing software for biological modeling, simulation, visualization, databasing, or other purposes, libraries such as <a href="software/libsbml">libSBML</a> and <a href="software/jsbml">JSBML</a> can help you support SBML. Make sure to read the <a href="documents/specifications">SBML specifications</a>, and ask questions in the relevant <a href="community/forums">discussion groups</a>!

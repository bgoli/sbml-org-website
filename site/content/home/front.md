#          first (top) section of the front page.
#
# Notes: DO NOT define the variable "title" here, because we use the 
# normal Hugo Academic list template and a definition for title will
# end up putting new (and unwanted) title text on the page.
#
# This page definition makes heavy use of raw HTML in-between
# Markdown-formatted text.  In Emacs, I often switch to html syntax
# mode manually when editing this page.

Welcome to the portal for the **Systems Biology Markup Language** (**SBML**), a free and open data format for computational systems biology that's used by thousands of people worldwide.  Here you can find out more about SBML, compatible software, upcoming events, and more.

  **What <em>is</em> SBML?**<br>
  SBML is a software data format for describing models in biology.  It's a little like HTML, but for [formal models instead of web pages](documents/what-is-sbml/).  It's independent of any particular software tool and not limited to any particular field of the life sciences.  It's open and free.

  **How do you use it?**<br>
  Many software tools and databases support SBML directly.  You don't write in SBML yourself&mdash;your software does it for you.  The [SBML Showcase](/facilities/showcase) can yelp you find SBML-compatible software, and the [BioModels Database](https://biomodels.net) can help you find published models.

  **Where do you get more information?**<br>
  The [Documents](/documents) section of this site contains the [SBML specifications](/documents/specifications) as well as other information such as [publications](/documents/publications), the [SBML Development](/documents/process), and the [SBML FAQ](/documents/faq).  The [Community](/community) section has info about [discussion groups](/community/forums) and upcoming [events](/community/events).

  **How can you support SBML in your own software?**<br>
  If you're developing software for biological modeling, simulation, visualization, databasing, or other purposes, libraries such as [libSBML](/software/libsbml) and [JSBML](/software/jsbml) can help you support SBML. Make sure to read the [SBML specifications](/documents/specifications), and ask questions in the relevant [discussion groups](/community/forums)!

  **Who's involved in SBML?**<br>
  SBML has been in development in a community-driven fashion since its creation in the year 2000. It has been made possible thanks to support from [many agencies and organizations](/about/funding), as well as contributions from [many motivated individuals](/about).

No matter how you use SBML, we invite you to sign up for news updates via either the [RSS news feed](/news/index.xml) for SBML.org, the [@sbmlnews Twitter feed](https://twitter.com/sbmlnews), or the very low-volume [sbml-announce](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/sbml-announce) mailing list.

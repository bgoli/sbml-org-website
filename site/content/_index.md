Welcome to the portal for the **Systems Biology Markup Language** (**SBML**), a free and open data format for computational systems biology that's used by thousands of people worldwide.  Here you can find out more about SBML, compatible software, upcoming events, and more.

{{% blurb title="What *is* SBML?" icon="info-circle" link="documents/what-is-sbml/" %}}
  SBML is a software data format for describing models in biology.  It's a little like HTML, but for [formal models instead of web pages](documents/what-is-sbml/).  It's independent of any particular software tool and not limited to any particular field of the life sciences.  It's open and free.

{{% blurb title="How do you use it?" icon="laptop-code" side="right" link="/facilities/showcase/" %}}
  Many software tools and databases support SBML directly.  You don't write in SBML yourself&mdash;your software does it for you.  The [SBML Showcase](/facilities/showcase) can yelp you find SBML-compatible software, and the [BioModels Database](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/biomodels) can help you find published models.

{{% blurb title="Where do you get more information?" icon="book" link="/documents/" %}}
  The [Documents](/documents) section of this site contains the [SBML specifications](/documents/specifications) as well as other information such as [publications](/documents/publications), the [SBML Development](/documents/process), and the [SBML FAQ](/documents/faq).  The [Community](/community) section has info about [discussion groups](/community/forums) and upcoming [events](/community/events).

{{% blurb title="How can you support SBML in your own software?" icon="code-branch" side="right" link="/software/" %}}
  If you're developing software for biological modeling, simulation, visualization, databasing, or other purposes, libraries such as [libSBML](/software/libsbml) and [JSBML](/software/jsbml) can help you support SBML. Make sure to read the [SBML specifications](/documents/specifications), and ask questions in the relevant [discussion groups](/community/forums)!

{{% blurb title="Who's involved in SBML?" icon="users" link="/about/" %}}
  SBML has been in development in a community-driven fashion since its creation in the year 2000. It has been made possible thanks to support from [many agencies and organizations](/about/funding), as well as contributions from [many motivated individuals](/about).

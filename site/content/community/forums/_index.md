Discussions about SBML and related topics takes place over several mailing lists implemented as Google Groups.  The forums area provides a web interface to the lists, and you can also subscribe to any lists you find interesting.

## General SBML-related forums

The mailing lists are where questions are asked and the latest developments discussed.  Please see the table below for more information about the different lists/groups available.

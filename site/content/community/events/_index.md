An important aspect of SBML development is face-to-face meetings, where developers, researchers and other interested persons meet each other and discuss their experiences and ongoing work.

## COMBINE and HARMONY (from 2010 onward)

The _<b>CO</b>mputational <b>M</b>odeling in <b>BI</b>ology <b>NE</b>twork_ (COMBINE) is an initiative to coordinate the development of standards and formats for computational models in biology.  It was established in 2010, and since that time, almost all SBML face-to-face meetings have occurred in the context of COMBINE.  There are two flavors of COMBINE events: _Forum_ meetings focus on general presentations and discussions about methods and software relevant to systems biology, while _Hackathons_ are codefest-type events bringing software developers together to work on interoperability of software and standards.

## Previous meetings and special events (2000&ndash;2011)

Prior to the establishment of COMBINE, the SBML community had its own series of biannual events: _SBML Forum Meetings_ were the annual working meetings of the SBML community and provided an opportunity to discuss SBML, its continued evolution, and software efforts to support SBML, while _SBML Hackathons_ brought together developers to discuss software interoperability of SBML-aware software. The community also organized occasional special workshops aimed at pushing forward the development of specific SBML features, as well as a 2008 "super-hackathon" that was a precursor of COMBINE.  And going back even further in time, the ERATO Kitano Symbotic Systems Project that produced SBML organized a series of workshops known as the _Workshop on Software Platforms for Systems Biology_, before this series was split and renamed into the SBML Forum and SBML Hackathon meetings.

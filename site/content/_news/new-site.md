summary = "SBML.org has been completely redesigned from the ground up!  A site refresh long in the making has finally been completed."
+++

The new SBML.org website uses [Hugo](https://gohugo.io), a framework for creating static website.  We started with the [Academic](https://github.com/gcushen/hugo-academic) theme for Hugo, and modified it to create a custom theme for SBML.org.  You're looking at the result!

The source files for the site are maintained [in a GitHub repository](https://github.com/sbmlteam/sbml-org-website), making version-tracking simple and making it possible for bug reports and pull requests for changes to be handled more easily than before.

In the process of developing the new site, we reexamined the previous site and its various sections, and thought about what content matters most and seems to get the most use.  The new site (this site) has some changes.  We hope you like the results.

A new release of SBML Level 3 Version 2 is now available.  This release addresses a small number of issues that were identified in Release&nbsp;1 since its release.  The issues include the following:

* Update URLs -- fix dead links, use https if possible.

* Clarify `rateOf` behavior at $t<0$.

* Extend relaxed unit rules to Compartment validation.

* Emphasize that the `metaid` attribute syntax is taken from XML 1.0, not 1.1.

* Clarify use of `bvar` in MathML `lambda` element of FunctionDefinition.

A few other issues have also been addressed.

The SBML Editors and SBML Team would like to thank all of the many 
members of the SBML community for their current support and use of SBML.

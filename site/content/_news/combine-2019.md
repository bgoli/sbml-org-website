The "Computational Modeling in Biology" Network (COMBINE) is an initiative to coordinate the development of the various community standards and formats in systems biology, synthetic biology and related fields. COMBINE 2019 will be a workshop-style event with invited lectures, oral presentations and posters, but also reserving enough time for afternoon breakout sessions. The five meeting days will include talks about the COMBINE standards and associated or related standardization efforts, as well as presentations of tools using these standards and similar topics. Some oral presentations will be selected from the abstracts submitted by the attendees. In addition, poster sessions will allow people to inform each other about their software and other projects in a setting that fosters interaction and in-depth discussion. The first day (Monday July 15th) will be a colloquium day celebrating the 10th anniversary of the COMBINE network. 

Many members of the SBML Team will be present at this year's COMBINE meeting, and Michael Hucka will be given an invited presentation on the history of COMBINE.

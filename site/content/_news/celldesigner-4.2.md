The CellDesigner development team has [announced the release of CellDesigner 4.4.2](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/sbml-discuss/lGCvLGjSFDU).

[CellDesigner](http://celldesigner.org) is a modeling tool of biochemical networks with a graphical user interface. It is designed to be SBML compatible, and SBW (Systems Biology Workbench) enabled.  CellDesigner runs on Windows, macOS and Linux, and it can import/export SBML Level-1 and Level-2 documents (with and without CellDesigner-specific SBML `<annotation>` tags).

The new features in this release include support for the [Garuda platform](http://gateway.garuda-alliance.org/GarudaCommunity/gadgets-main.jsp), new APIs, support for more operating systems including macOS Mojave, and miscellaneous bug fixes and updates.

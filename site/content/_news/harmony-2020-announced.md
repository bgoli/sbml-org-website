HARMONY 2020 is being organized by Henning Hermjakob at EMBL-EBI (Cambridge, UK), March 9â€“13, 2020.  More details will be forthcoming.

The Hackathons on Resources for Modeling in Biology (HARMONY) are a series of Hackathon-type meetings, with a focus on development of the support for standards, their interoperability and software infrastructure. Focus is not on general discussions or oral presentations but hands-on hacking and interaction between people focused on practical development of standards and supporting software. The participants are generally developers.

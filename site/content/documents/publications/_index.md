The following are published papers and chapters describing SBML and core SBML supporting tools (e.g., libraries). Please note that _none of these publications is normative in the sense of defining_ SBML. These papers and chapters only provide context and perspectives about SBML and its development.  Only the [SBML specification documents](/documents/specifications) are normative.

This page does not cover associated standards to use in conjunction with SBML. Please consult the documentation of the [COMBINE initiative](http://co.mbine.org) for entries point to relevant documentation. This page does not cover end-user software either; please visit the [SBML Software](/downloads) area and the [SBML Showcase](/showcase) for more information on libraries and software supporting SBML.

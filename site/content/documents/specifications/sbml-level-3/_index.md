## SBML Level 3 Packages

Each Level 3 package effort has its own detailed status page. Please follow the links below for more information, including any specifications that may be available. This list is in alphabetical order by package label. The information in this table is drawn from the [master table for Level 3 package statuses](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1pa01Z72t1UKrjliAXBhxjjN1nnOf00gXcfm4_pWXOxA).

Note that packages are developed by separate groups apart from the SBML Editors. If you use an SBML Level&nbsp;3 Package in your software or your work, **please cite the publication associated with the package** to give credit to the package developers. Citation information is given in the package detail pages, linked below.

SBML Level 3 package specification documents are written using a [standardized LaTeX template](https://doi.org/10.1186/s13104-017-2788-1) developed by the SBML Team for this purpose. The template is freely available for use by other efforts.

In SBML Level 1, the approach of using _Releases_ of SBML specifications was not yet instituted for producing updated revisions within a given SBML Level/Version combination. Only the "Final" versions of Level&nbsp;1 Version&nbsp;1 and Version&nbsp;2 exist.

Although [XML Schemas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML_schema) are available for SBML Level&nbsp;1, <strong>the schemas only capture the basic syntax</strong> of the format.  Semantics and correct usage are <strong>not</strong> captured by the schemas and can only be understood by reading the specification documents.

## SBML Level 1 Version 1

{{% notice type="danger" %}}
Because of problems in SBML Level 1 Version 1 (corrected in Version&nbsp;2), we recommend that *no new models* be created in Version&nbsp;1 format and that users should convert existing Version&nbsp;1 models to Version&nbsp;2. The Version&nbsp;1 specification is made available for reference purposes only.

## Notes about this specification

The "groups" specfication is considered stable and in use.  At the time of this writing (April 2020), there are no active efforts to develop another version.


## Notes about third-party application support

**2020**: The groups package is known to be actively used by models in the [BiGG Models](http://bigg.ucsd.edu) database, as well as the following software applications:

* [ModelPolisher](https://github.com/draeger-lab/ModelPolisher/), where it is mainly used to indicate which reactions belong to the same subsystem (a different name for traditional pathways or other functional groups within a model)
* [Metadraft](https://systemsbioinformatics.github.io/cbmpy-metadraft/) since at least [version 0.9.2](http://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3363099)
* [CBMPy](http://cbmpy.sourceforge.net/) as of [version 0.7.25](http://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3358765)
* [KEGGtranslator](https://github.com/draeger-lab/KEGGtranslator)

The use of Releases/Revisions was introduced after Level 2 Version 1 was developed; consequently, for Level&nbsp;2 Version&nbsp;1, there is no "Release" or "Revision" designation.

{{% notice type="danger" %}}
Note that Version 1 has significant limitations and conceptual gaps. The SBML Editors strongly encourage developers to update existing Version 1-supporting tools to support a later version of SBML Level 2 or SBML Level&nbsp3;. Similarly, we courage modelers who have models in Version 1 format to update their models to a later Version.

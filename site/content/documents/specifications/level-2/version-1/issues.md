# This is the source file for producing an errata page for this SBML
# specification. The information in this file header (what you are reading
# right now, between the "+++" delimiters in this file) is used to produce
# the content of the final displayed page. The logic for producing that
# content is encoded in the layout page template. The template is found in
# the directory site/layouts/_default/.
#
# The issue/errata summaries need to be written by a human, and hence are not
# found in any other location than the present file.  See the other issue
# files for an example of the syntax, but the basic idea is, start each new
# issue with "[[issue]]" followed by keyword-value pairs.  The keywords are
# "id", "link", "location", "date" and "description".

description = "If a species identifier occurs in any MathML `ci` element, including inside `kineticLaw` and `stoichiometryMath` elements, then it should appear in a `simpleSpeciesReference` element in the containing reaction.

The eventAssignment structure will have effect at _t1 + d_ and _t2 + d_ irrespective of the relative times of _t1_ and _t2_. For example, events can overlap in time so that _t1 < t2 < t1 + d_ still causes an event assignment to occur at _t1 + d_ and _t2 + d_."

[[issue]]
id = "23"
link = ""
date = "not recorded"
location = "p. 55 appendix A and the SCHUCS notation document p.14 section 3.9"
description = "The SCHUCS notation document (and by default appendix A) states that UML inheritance is mapped, in XML Schema, to extension of complexType elements. This is by far the most natural interpretation and the one used in the schema available on the SBML website and used by libSBML. However, this approach introduces a restriction: an ordering of elements is imposed on all extended types because the definition of XML Schema effectively requires the use of sequence ordering in order to be able to use type inheritance in this way. (A full explanation of the details can be found in sec. 13.5 of the book Definitive XML Schema, 2002, by P. Walmsley.) The result is that the ordering of subelements in SBML XML is important: they must appear in the order shown in the UML diagrams in the specification and subelements inherited from super-classes must occur before those of derived classes. For example, notes and annotation elements must occur before listOfReactants elements within a reaction element. Appendix A should state this restriction explicitly. This is an argument for moving appendix A into the main text. The dependence on sequence is a result of using XML Schema."

date = "not recorded"
location = "p. 55 appendix A and SCHUCS notation document p.5 section 3.2 onwards"
description = "The SCHUCS document doesn't state what model group element should be used in the XML schema interpretation of UML. (Examples of XML schema are that `xs:element` elements should be enclosed in `xs:choice`, `xs:all` or `xs:sequence` elements; see p.488 table A-1 of Walmsley's book Definitive XML Schema, 2002.) Perhaps to be consistent with the erratum noted above, `xs:sequence` elements should be used. (The SBML schemas currently use this interpretation). In some instances, `xsd:all` could be used, but this has repercussions for type inheritance."

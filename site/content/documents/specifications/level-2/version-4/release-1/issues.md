# This is the source file for producing an errata page for this SBML
# specification. The information in this file header (what you are reading
# right now, between the "+++" delimiters in this file) is used to produce
# the content of the final displayed page. The logic for producing that
# content is encoded in the layout page template. The template is found in
# the directory site/layouts/_default/.
#
# The issue/errata summaries need to be written by a human, and hence are not
# found in any other location than the present file.  See the other issue
# files for an example of the syntax, but the basic idea is, start each new
# issue with "[[issue]]" followed by keyword-value pairs.  The keywords are
# "id", "link", "location", "date" and "description".

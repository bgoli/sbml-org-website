Note: the term _Releases_ was introduced in SBML Level&nbsp;2 Version&nbsp;3; the Release approach is used to cope with minor editorial changes to specification documents. Prior to that, in Version&nbsp;2, the same concept existed under the name _Revision_, but only one revision of Level&nbsp;2 Version&nbsp;2 was ever produced.

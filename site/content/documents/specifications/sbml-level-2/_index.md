First, an explanation is in order. The term _Releases_ was introduced in SBML Level&nbsp;2 Version&nbsp;3; the Release approach is used to cope with minor editorial changes to specification documents. Prior to that, in Version&nbsp;2, the same concept existed under the name _Revision_, but only one revision of Level&nbsp;2 Version&nbsp;2 was ever produced. In SBML Level&nbsp;2 Version&nbsp;1, the Release/Revision concept was not used at all.

To make matters simpler, this page lists all previously issued specifications of SBML Level&nbsp;2, regardless of whether they were Releases of Version&nbsp;5, or past Versions.

Developers and modelers are **strongly encouraged** to support the **latest** Version in any new software development and modeling efforts, as well as to update actively-supported software tools they may be involved in developing or maintaining.

## SBML Level 2 Version 2

As noted above, SBML Level 2 Version 2 existed in only one Revision.

{{< sbml-spec-box package="core" level="2" version="2" revision="1" >}}



## SBML Level 2 Version 1

As noted above, the use of Releases/Revisions was introduced after Level 2 Version 1 was developed; consequently, for Level&nbsp;2 Version&nbsp;1, there is no "Release" or "Revision" designation.

Note that Version 1 has significant limitations and conceptual gaps. The SBML Editors strongly encourage developers to update existing Version 1-supporting tools to support a later version of SBML Level 2. Similarly, we courage modelers who have models in Version 1 format to update their models to a later Version.

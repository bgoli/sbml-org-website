# This page is all HTML makes because it was easier to get the results
# I wanted that way.  However, I left it as a .md file in order to be
# consistent with the other files in this site (and thus hopefully
# less confusing for future maintainers).  Beware that this TOML 
# block at the beginning of the file is nevertheless not an HTML 
# comment and you must not turn it into one or things won't work.

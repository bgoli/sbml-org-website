The SBML Scientific Advisory Board (SAB) is composed of scientists and
researchers with expertise in topics covered by SBML. The SAB provides
guidance to the SBML Editors and the SBML Forum regarding the goals,
features, applications, and other aspects of SBML development and use.

[Dr. Michael Hucka](http://www.cds.caltech.edu/~mhucka/) is the chair of
the SBML SAB.

## SAB duties and activities

Broadly speaking, the duties of the SBML Scientific Advisory Board are
to advocate the use of SBML in their communities where appropriate, to
make recommendations about technical directions and decisions, to check
that the development of SBML is democratic, and to help locate financial
support for SBML development. The scientific committee does not have
decision-making power on the content of SBML, although its advice
carries considerable weight in the decisions taken by the SBML Editors
and the SBML community as a whole.

## SAB governance

The following are specific characteristics of SBML SAB membership:

  - *Invitation*: Members are proposed by the SBML Editors and the
    existing SAB. Invited members are typically pioneers or major
    figures in the field of computational systems biology, or leading
    figures in fields that may endorse SBML.

<!-- end list -->

  - *Duration*: SAB membership is 2 years long, renewable without
    restriction. Renewal must be proposed and seconded by existing
    members of the SAB and the SBML Editors.

<!-- end list -->

  - *Meeting schedule*: A formal meeting of the SBML SAB is convened
    once per year. The meeting may be face to face or virtual. More
    meetings may be convened at the discretion of the SAB and the SBML
    Editors.

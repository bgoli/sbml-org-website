The election of SBML Editors is executed by the Chair of the
SBML Editors, with assistance from the current editors. Note that
although the Chair and Editors may be involved in *implementing* an
election, the ultimate selection of each editor is in the hands of the
SBML community via a majority vote. The process is designed to provide
checks and balances to avoid the influence of personal bias on the part
of the Chair and the Editors.

## Election procedure

1.  *Call for nominations*
    1.  The call for nominations will be issued no later than November
        of each year to the [sbml-discuss](http://sbml.org/Forums)
        mailing list.
          - Nominations will be made electronically via an anonymous
            submission form; persons submitting nominations are not
            required to reveal their identity.
          - Individuals may nominate themselves.
          - Nominations must include the name and contact (email)
            information for the nominee, and optionally may include an
            explanation for why the nominator believes the nominee would
            make a good and technically competent SBML Editor.
          - The nomination database system will be kept confidential,
            revealed only to the Chair and the current SBML Editors, who
            will have full access to the database to help guard against
            tampering by anyone among them.
    2.  The period for nominations will be a minimum of two weeks and a
        maximum of four weeks.
    3.  After the nomination period ends, the Chair will perform the
        following steps:
        1.  Remove false (spam) submissions and do any other necessary
            bookkeeping.
        2.  Contact each nominee and confirm that the individual either
            accepts or declines the nomination.
        3.  Produce a final list of nominees who accept the nomination.
        4.  Start the next step.
2.  *Call for votes*
    1.  The call for votes will be issued no later than December of each
        year on the [sbml-discuss](http://sbml.org/Forums) mailing list.
    2.  The election ballot will include the following information about
        each candidate:
          - Name and institution/organization.
          - Reasons given by the nominator for nominating the
            individual.
    3.  The election ballot will require that each voter provide his/her
        name and address.
          - Only votes from registered members of the SBML Forum (see
            above) will be counted in the final tally. Current SBML
            Editors and the Chair of the SBML Editors, being members of
            the SBML Forum, are permitted to vote.
          - The voting database will be kept confidential; no one
            besides the Chair and the current SBML Editors will have
            access to the voting records.
    4.  Each voter can vote for only one candidate.
    5.  Candidates may vote for themselves.
    6.  The period for nominations will be a minimum of two weeks and a
        maximum of four weeks.
    7.  After the voting period ends, the Chair will perform the
        following steps:
        1.  Remove false (spam) submissions and do any other necessary
            bookkeeping.
        2.  Check each vote against the registration list for the
            [sbml-discuss](http://sbml.org/Forums) mailing list and
            discount votes from individuals who are not registered
            members of the SBML Forum.
        3.  Check for multiple votes by the same individual. In the case
            of multiple votes, all but the last vote will be discarded.
        4.  Tally the results for each candidate.
        5.  Rank the candidates by number of votes received.
        6.  Go to the next step.
3.  *Confirmation and selection*
    1.  If the highest ranking is shared by two or more candidates, the
        *Tie-breaking* step (\#4 below) is invoked.
    2.  Otherwise, the Chair will contact the highest-ranked candidate
        and confirm a final time that they either accept or decline the
        role of SBML Editor for a three-year period. (It is *expected*
        that anyone who agrees to be put on the ballot will serve if
        elected. However, events in life can happen in-between
        nomination and the completion of the election. This final
        confirmation step is taken to confirm the prospective editor
        will make the commitment.)
        1.  If the candidate declines, the election is consider invalid.
            A new election must be performed beginning with step 2,
            after removing he declining candidate's name from the
            ballot.
4.  *Tie-breaking* (if necessary)
    1.  In the event of a tie for the choice of Editor(s), the Chair
        will implement a run-off election consisting of only the
        candidates who are tied.
    2.  The run-off election will be held as soon as possible after the
        end of the regular election ("Call for votes" above).
    3.  The run-off election will last for one week.
    4.  The procedure will be otherwise the same as the regular election
        ("Call for votes" above).
5.  *Announcement*
    1.  The announcement of the winning Editor(s) will be made in
        December.
    2.  The Chair will issue an announcement on the
        [sbml-discuss](http://sbml.org/Forums) mailing list about the
        winning Editors after the regular voting and any necessary
        run-off elections are finished.
    3.  The newly elected SBML Editor(s) will serve beginning on January
        1 of the next year.

## Confidentiality policy

The results of voting will be kept strictly confidential by the Chair
and SBML Editors. Although complete anonymity is not possible (*someone*
has to tally the votes, remove votes by non-members, deal with multiple
votes, etc.), the SBML Editors and the Chair recognize that breaching
confidentiality would irrevocably damage the broader SBML community's
confidence in the election process, and therefore confidentiality must
be maintained.

  abstract = {Summary: The specifications of the Systems Biology Markup Language
	(SBML) define standards for storing and exchanging computer models
	of biological processes in text files. In order to perform model
	simulations, graphical visualizations, and other software manipulations,
	an in-memory representation of SBML is required. We developed JSBML
	for this purpose. In contrast to prior implementations of SBML APIs,
	JSBML has been designed from the ground up for the Java\texttrademark{}
	programming language, and can therefore be used on all platforms
	supported by a Java Runtime Environment. This offers important benefits
	for Java users, including the ability to distribute software as Java
	Web Start applications. JSBML supports all SBML Levels and Versions
	through Level~3 Version~1, and we have strived to maintain the highest
	possible degree of compatibility with the popular library libSBML.
	JSBML also supports modules that can facilitate the development of
	plugins for end-user applications, as well as ease migration from
	a libSBML-based backend. Availability: Source code, binaries, and
	documentation for JSBML can be freely obtained under the terms of
	the LGPL 2.1 from the website \url{http://sbml.org/Software/JSBML}.},

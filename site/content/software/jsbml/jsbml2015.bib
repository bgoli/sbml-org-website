  abstract = {Summary: JSBML, the official pure Java programming library for the SBML format, has
    evolved with the advent of different modeling formalisms in systems biology and their ability to
    be exchanged and represented via extensions of SBML. JSBML has matured into a major, active
    open-source project with contributions from a growing, international team of developers who not
    only maintain compatibility with SBML, but also drive steady improvements to the Java interface
    and promote ease-of-use with end users.

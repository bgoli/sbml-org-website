## SBML models

The SBML Project does not itself produce models; our efforts are more directed towards developing infrastructure for modeling. However, our alliances and related projects _do_ produce models.

  An open and free database of models curated by humans, [BioModels Database](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/biomodels/) allows biologists to store, search and retrieve published mathematical models of biological interests. Models are annotated and linked to relevant data resources, such as publications, databases of compounds and pathways, controlled vocabularies, and more.

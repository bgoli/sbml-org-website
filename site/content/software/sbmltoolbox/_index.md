SBMLToolbox is built on top of [libSBML](/software/libsbml) and provides a set of basic functions allowing SBML models to be used in both [MATLAB](https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html) and [Octave](https://www.gnu.org/software/octave/). SBMLToolbox provides functions for creating and validating models; and manipulating and simulating these models using ordinary differential equation solvers. It is written by [Sarah M. Keating](https://github.com/skeating) and made available under [LGPL](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/old-licenses/lgpl-2.1.en.html) terms.

## More about SBMLToolbox

SBMLToolbox works by translating SBML models to/from a MATLAB structure called `MATLAB_SBML`. It provides facilities for manipulating this and its substructures within either the MATLAB or Octave environments. The [libSBML](/software/libsbml) binding enables the import and export of these structures to and from SBML files.

The toolbox is not intended to be a complete systems biology toolbox for MATLAB, but rather a platform facilitating getting SBML in and out of MATLAB and serving as a starting point from which users can develop their own functionality.


## Compatibility note

A number of third-party MATLAB toolboxes use SBMLToolbox. **Beware that they may have restrictions on the version of SBMLToolbox with which they are compatible. For example, some are only compatible with version 2.0.2, not the current version 4 of SBMLToolbox.** Please make sure to check the third-party software's documentation to determine which version of SBMLToolbox it needs.

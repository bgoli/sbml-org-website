LibSBML provides APIs for programming in C, C++, C#, Java, JavaScript, MATLAB, Perl, PHP, Python, R, and Ruby.  The following are the currently-available API manuals, documenting the APIs for a subset of the languages supported by libSBML:

* [C](c)
* [C++](c++)
* [C#](csharp)
* [Java](java)
* [Python](python)
* [MATLAB](matlab)

### Other languages and third-party bindings

Above are listed the officially supported languages.  For other languages, looking at the [C++](c++-api) documentation gives a good sense for what is availble in that language.  Additionally, there are bindings for libSBML in other languages maintained by third-party developers:

* [Julia](https://github.com/LCSB-BioCore/SBML.jl)

The annual Computational Cell Biology Workshop organized by UCHC will be offered online, August 3&ndash;5, 2020.

It will provide didactic content to introduce participants to modeling, including tutorials for the COPASI, SpringSaLaD and Virtual Cell software platforms. We also will offer participants virtual “hands-on” help in developing models in support of their individual research. It will include a combination of plenary sessions, parallel sessions and breakout sessions for one-on-one model building. Throughout the 3 days, there will be opportunities for participants to describe their own modeling projects.

To apply for the course, please email to Les Loew (les@uchc.edu<mailto:les@uchc.edu>) answering the questions below; this will help us design the workshop to optimize its benefit to you:

1.  Which tools are you interested in learning:
    *   COPASI http://copasi.org/
    *   Virtual Cell http://vcell.org/
    *   SpringSaLaD https://vcell.org/ssalad

2.  Are you
    *   A novice at modeling who can benefit from general introductions to kinetic and reaction-diffusion systems?
    *   An experienced modeler interested in advanced topics? If so, please list some topics that you would like to learn about.

3.  Do you have a modeling project that you would like to work on with our help? If so, please send us a short description of your project.

The deadline for application is July 10th.

Thank you,
Michael Blinov

The [Center for Reproducible Biomedical Modeling](https://reproduciblebiomodels.org) has been hosting virtual webinars since its inception.  For Summer 2019, the seminar series is transitioning to a monthly [interactive workshop](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/sbml-discuss/q21Nq-9AklM). Each month, the workshop will address one of five key elements on biomodeling: parameter estimation, modeling languages, model validation, data aggregation, and simulation platforms. The workshop will feature demos of biomodeling tools and discussions of methodologies.

The workshop organizers "invite modeling software developers willing to share and demo a new tool of interest to the modeling community".  You can find more information [on the website](http://reproduciblebiomodels.org/dissemination-and-training/seminar/) and contact them if you are interested in discussing your software.

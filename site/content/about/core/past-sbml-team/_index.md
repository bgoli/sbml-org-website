The SBML effort has greatly benefitted from the involvement of many talented individuals over the years. Some are still active in SBML; others have moved on to other exciting work. The following list is in alphabetical order:

- **Kimberly Begley** worked as a consultant during 2008 on the SBML Test Suite. She has degrees in both Computer Science and Biology and is a Bioinformatics Consultant working in Australia. She has over a decade of experience developing database and XML systems for groups including [QFAB](http://www.qfab.org/), [MDS Proteomics](http://www.mdsinc.com/), Blueprint, and [Lilly Systems Biology](http://www.lscdd.lilly.com.sg/lscdd/index.html).  She is now the Managing Director, [Chronic Pain Network at McMaster University](https://cpn.mcmaster.ca/contact-us).
- [**Frank Bergmann**](http://frank-fbergmann.blogspot.com/) worked on many software systems and services, including the online SBML validator, the SBML Test Suite, the SBML Test Suite Database, libSBML, and more.
- [**Hamid Bolouri**](http://www.its.caltech.edu/~hbolouri/) was the leader of the Caltech SBML & SBW Team from 1999 until 2003, as well as the University of Hertfordshire SBML Team for several years. In addition to Hamid's roles in the initial development of SBML, his group developed several SBML-related software resources (including the first SBML model repository and online SBML validator), and was the alma mater of Maria Schilstra, Sarah Keating, Joanne Matthews, and others. He continues to perform research in systems biology, and recently published two new books ([Computational Modeling of Gene Regulatory Networks—A Primer](http://www.icpress.co.uk/lifesci/p567.html) and [Personal Genomics and Personalized Medicine](http://www.worldscibooks.com/lifesci/p716.html)).
- [**Ben Bornstein**](http://www.bbornstein.org/) is a software engineer at the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory. He is the architect of [libSBML](Software/libSBML) and for a long time was its primary developer; he also developed the second generation of the SBML [online validator](Facilities/Validator). At NASA he's been even more productive, and in 2011, one of his projects (where he was a technical lead) won [NASA's 2011 Software of the Year award](http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.cfm?release=2011-380).
- [**Andrew M. Finney**](http://uk.linkedin.com/in/andrewmartinfinney) was a member of the SBML Team from the very beginning. Until his return to industry, he was one of SBML's chief architects and greatest contributors.
- [**Akira Funahashi**](http://www.bio.keio.ac.jp/research/staff/funahashi.html), Ph.D. in Computer Science, co-developed [ KEGG2SBML](Software/KEGG2SBML) and [CellDesigner](http://celldesigner.org/) (née SBEdit), as well as contributed to libSBML, and has been involved with such things as SBGN from the very beginning. At the beginning of the SBML project, Akira was a researcher in the [Kitano Symbiotic Systems Project](http://www.symbio.jst.go.jp/symbio2/) and [The SBI](http://sbi.jp/). Today he is an Associate Professor in the [Dept. of Biosciences and Informatics](http://www.bio.keio.ac.jp/research/staff/funahashi.html) at Keio University.
- **Thomas M. Hamm** was a Ph.D. student at the [Applied Bioinformatics Group](http://abi.inf.uni-tuebingen.de/) at the University of Tuebingen. He is a co-developer of [JSBML](http://sbml.org/Software/JSBML).
- [**Enuo He**](https://uk.linkedin.com/in/heenuo) was a visiting student in the BNMC during 2007. She worked on both developing test cases for the SBML Test Suite and on curating models for [BioModels Database](http://www.ebi.ac.uk/biomodels). She is now at the University of Oxford pursuing her Ph.D.
- **Akiya Jouraku** was a member of SBML Team from 2007 to 2010 while he was a Research Assistant in the [Dept. of Biosciences and Informatics](http://www.bio.keio.ac.jp/) at Keio University, Japan.  He developed several aspects of [ libSBML](Software/libSBML), including the plug-in system for libSBML 5 and the file compression capability. He also co-developed [CellDesigner](http://celldesigner.org) and [KEGG2SBML](Software/KEGG2SBML). His research interests include systems biology, interconnection networks, and parallel processing.
- [**Ben Kovitz**](http://www.linkedin.com/in/benkovitz) is a freelance software engineer who worked on many things in SBML and SBW, including having written the wiki engine that ran the sbml.org website from 2002 to 2008, parts of libSBML, and [RFC 3823](http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc3823.html) defining the MIME type for SBML. He is now pursuing a Ph.D. at Indiana University.
- **Joanne Matthews** was a research programmer at the [University of Hertfordshire](http://www.herts.ac.uk), UK, in Maria Schilstra's group. Among other things, she worked on [CellML2SBML](Software/CellML2SBML) as well as the first generation of the SBML.org online tools.
- [**Herbert M.  Sauro**](http://depts.washington.edu/bioe/people/core/sauro/sauro.html) was another original member of the SBML Team and the implementor of the earliest SBML-aware simulation software, Jarnac and JDesigner.  He is now faculty at the University of Washington.
- [**Maria J. Schilstra**](http://strc.herts.ac.uk/bio/maria/) developed the original [CellML2SBML](Software/CellML2SBML) and the first [NetBuilder](http://strc.herts.ac.uk/bio/maria/NetBuilder), the latter being one of the first applications to understand SBML when SBML was first introduced. Maria also created the first SBML model repository, the contents of which seeded the very first instantiation of [BioModels Database](http://www.ebi.ac.uk/biomodels). She has also made many other contributions to SBML over the years. Maria is currently the group leader of the [Biological and Neural Computation Laboratory](http://homepages.feis.herts.ac.uk/~nngroup/bncg.html) at the [University of Hertfordshire](http://www.herts.ac.uk), UK.
- [**Bruce E. Shapiro**](http://www.bruce-shapiro.com/) is now the director of the [BNMC](http://bnmc.caltech.edu), focusing on computational morphodynamics. Bruce developed the Mathematica-based [MathSBML](Software/MathSBML) package which served for several years as the package used to generate reference simulation results for the SBML Test Suite. Today he continues to develop and support [Cellerator](http://cellerator.org) and related plugins and extensions. His interests include computational morphodynamics, computational neuroscience, and modeling of signal transduction networks.

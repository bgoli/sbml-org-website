Late in the year 1999 through early 2000, with funding from the [Japan Science and Technology Corporation (JST)](http://www.jst.go.jp/EN/), [Hiroaki Kitano](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hiroaki_Kitano) and [John C. Doyle](http://www.cds.caltech.edu/~doyle/) assembled a small team of researchers to work on developing better software infrastructure for [computational modeling](http://en.wikipedia.org/computer_model) in [systems biology](http://en.wikipedia.org/systems_biology). Hamid Bolouri was the leader of the development team, which consisted of Andrew Finney, Herbert Sauro, and Michael Hucka. Bolouri identified the need for a framework to enable interoperability and sharing between the different simulation software systems for biology in existence during the late 1990's, and he organized an informal workshop in December 1999 at the [California Institute of Technology](http://www.caltech.edu) to discuss the matter. In attendance at that workshop were the groups responsible for the development of DBSolve, [E-Cell](http://ecell.sourceforge.net/), [Gepasi](http://www.gepasi.org), [Jarnac](http://sbw.kgi.edu/software/jarnac.htm), [StochSim](http://www.pdn.cam.ac.uk/groups/comp-cell/StochSim.html) and [The Virtual Cell](http://www.nrcam.uchc.edu/). Separately, earlier in 1999, some members of these groups also [had discussed](http://groups.google.com/group/bionet.metabolic-reg/browse_thread/thread/61a3b43291a8d1c5?pli=1) the creation of a portable file format for metabolic network models in the BioThermoKinetics (BTK) group. The same groups who attended the first Caltech workshop met again on April 28-29, 2000, at the first of a newly-created meeting series called [ Workshop on Software Platforms for Systems Biology](Events/Workshops/The_1st_Workshop_on_Software_Platforms_for_Systems_Biology "wikilink").  It became clear during the second workshop that a *common model representation format* was needed to enable the exchange of models between software tools as part of any functioning interoperability framework, and the workshop attendees decided the format should be encoded in XML.

The Caltech ERATO team developed a proposal for this XML-based format and circulated the draft definition to the attendees of the 2nd Workshop on Software Platforms for Systems Biology in August, 2000. This draft underwent extensive discussion over mailing lists and during the [ 2nd Workshop on Software Platforms for Systems Biology](Events/Workshops/The_2nd_Workshop_on_Software_Platforms_for_Systems_Biology "wikilink"), held in Tokyo, Japan, in November 2000 as a satellite workshop of the [ICSB 2000](http://www.symbio.jst.go.jp/systemsbiology/icsb/) conference. After further revisions, discussions and software implementations, the Caltech team issued a specification for [SBML Level 1, Version 1](http://www.sbml.org/specifications/sbml-level-1/version-1/) in March, 2001.

SBML Level 2 was conceived at the [ 5th Workshop on Software Platforms for Systems Biology](Events/Workshops/The_5th_Workshop_on_Software_Platforms_for_Systems_Biology "wikilink"), held in July 2002, at the [University of Hertfordshire](http://www.herts.ac.uk/), UK. By this time, far more people were involved than the original group of SBML collaborators and the continued evolution of SBML became a larger community effort, with many new tools having been enhanced to support SBML. The workshop participants in 2002 collectively decided to revise the form of SBML in Level 2. The first draft of the [Level 2 Version 1](http://www.sbml.org/specifications/sbml-level-2/version-1) specification was released in August 2002, and the final set of features was finalized in May 2003 at the 7th Workshop on Software Platforms for Systems Biology in Ft. Lauderdale, Florida.

The next iteration of SBML took two years in part because software developers requested time to absorb and understand the larger and more complex SBML Level 2. The inevitable discovery of limitations and errors led to the development of [SBML Level 2 Version 2](http://www.sbml.org/specifications/sbml-level-2/version-2), issued in September 2006. By this time, the team of SBML Editors (who reconcile proposals for changes and write a coherent final specification document) had changed and now consisted of Andrew Finney, Michael Hucka and Nicolas Le Novère.

[SBML Level 2 Version 3](http://www.sbml.org/specifications/sbml-level-2/version-3) was published in 2007 after countless contributions by and discussions with the SBML community. 2007 also saw the election of two more SBML Editors as part of the introduction of the modern SBML Editor organization in the context of the [ SBML development process](Documents/SBML_Development_Process "wikilink").

[SBML Level 2 Version 4](http://www.sbml.org/specifications/sbml-level-2/version-4) was published in 2008 after certain changes in Level 2 were requested by popular demand. (For example, an electronic vote by the SBML community in late 2007 indicated a majority preferred not to require strict unit consistency before an SBML model is considered valid.) Version 4 was finalized after the SBML Forum meeting held in Gothenburg, Sweden, as a satellite workshop of [ICSB 2008](http://icsb-2008.org) in the fall of 2008.

[SBML Level 3 Version 1 Core](http://sbml.org/Documents/Specifications#SBML_Level_3) was published in final form in 2010, after prolonged discussion and revision by the [SBML Editors](http://sbml.org/About) and the SBML community. It contains numerous significant changes in syntax and constructs from Level 2 Version 4, but also represents a new modular base for continued expansion of SBML's features and capabilities going into the future.

Notes about the site organization:

* The front page/home page is index.md

* The subdirectories under here mirror the sections in the site.  (This is a standard Hugo convention.)  The subdirectories establish the hierarchy of paths in the site. For example, "documents" becomes https://sbml.org/documents/.

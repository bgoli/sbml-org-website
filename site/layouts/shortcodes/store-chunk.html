Description : Shortcode for creating a reusable chunk of text on a page

This is one of a paper of shortcodes. The shortcode "store-chunk" is used to
define a named chunk of text (which can contain Markdown syntax), and the
other shortcode, "insert-chunk", is used to insert the named chunk a given 
location on the page. The primary use-case for this is to avoid copy-pasting
content on a page in situations where the same text needs to be repeated in
multiple places.

Why are there 2 shortcodes, instead of a single one that can be used both to 
define and retrieve a chunk, depending on the arguments given? Because the
Hugo syntax for a shortcode that takes a multiline body (needed to define a
chunk) handles .Inner differently than the syntax for a single-line shortcode.

{{ $name := .Get "name" }}
{{ $value := .Inner | markdownify }}
{{- .Page.Scratch.SetInMap "definitions" $name $value -}}

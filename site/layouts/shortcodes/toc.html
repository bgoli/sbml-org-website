<!-- 
  Hugo automatically creates a table of contents from the document
  Markdown structure and stores it in .TableOfContents. The HTML
  it produces is hardwired (in Hugo) to be a <nav> element with id 
  TableOfContents.  See https://gohugo.io/content-management/toc/.
  In order to add a title, we have to wrap everything in another
  div so that we can control the placement of the title relative
  to the nav element.

<div class="toc col-md-4">
  <div class="toc-border">
    <span class="toc-title">{{ i18n "table_of_contents" }}</span>
    {{ $.Page.TableOfContents }}
  </div>
</div>

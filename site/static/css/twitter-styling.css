   Description : CSS to style the Twitter timeline shown on /news

   Note #1: this style sheet is installed by /static/js/twitter-styling.js

   Note #2: this style sheet does not have access to the dark mode class
   added to the <body> tag in the overall page.  The reason is that this
   style sheet is placed inside the <iframe> holding the Twitter widget,
   and <iframe>'s are their own environment.  This means that we can't do
   things like define colors based on the class "body.dark".  The approach
   taken instead is to pick colors that are reasonable in both light and
   dark modes.  That's not great, but easier and simpler to maintain than
   if we had to write more JavaScript code that switched the style sheet
   based on the dark mode toggle used by Hugo Academic.

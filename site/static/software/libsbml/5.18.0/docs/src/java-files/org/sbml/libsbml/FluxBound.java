/**

 Max or min value for a reaction flux.
 <p>
 * The {@link FluxBound} class of objects is used in Version&nbsp;1 of the SBML
 * Level&nbsp;3 <a href='../../../extensions-summary.html#fbc'>Flux Balance Constraints</a> (&ldquo;fbc&rdquo;) package to express a single
 * (in)equality that provides the maximum or minimum value that a reaction
 * flux can obtain at steady state.  (This same information is encoded
 * differently in Version&nbsp;2 of &ldquo;fbc&rdquo;; see the
 * 'upperFluxBound' and 'lowerFluxBound' attributes on {@link FbcReactionPlugin}.)
 <p>
 * <h2>Attributes on {@link FluxBound}</h2>
 <p>
 * In addition to the common optional attributes 'id' and 'name', {@link FluxBound}
 * takes three required attributes: 'reaction', 'operation' and 'value'.
 * These three attributes define the meaning of the {@link FluxBound}, and are
 * interpreted using the following expression:
 * <center>
 * <em>reaction</em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>operator</em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>value</em>
 * </center>
 <p>
 * The 'reaction' attribute takes a value of <code>SIdRef</code>.  The value
 * must be the identifier of a {@link Reaction} object defined within the enclosing
 * model.
 <p>
 * The 'operation' attribute takes a value from
 * a set of constants
 * whose names begin with <code>FLUXBOUND_</code> representing
 * different mathematical inequalities. Possible values for 'operation' include
 * <code>'greaterEqual'</code>, <code>'equal'</code>, and others.
 <p>
 * The 'value' attribute takes a numerical value of type <code>double</code>,
 * and represents the value of the flux bound.  The permitted values include
 * positive infinity (<code>'INF'</code>) and negative infinity
 * (<code>'-INF'</code>).
 <p>
 * The following is an example of a set of flux bounds encoded in this form; it
 * also demonstrates the use of {@link ListOfFluxBounds}.
 <p>
 * <pre class='fragment'>
&lt;fbc:listOfFluxBounds&gt;
    &lt;fbc:fluxBound fbc:id='R1b' fbc:reaction='R1' fbc:operation='greaterEqual' fbc:value='1.2'/&gt;
    &lt;fbc:fluxBound fbc:id='R2b' fbc:reaction='R2' fbc:operation='lessEqual' fbc:value='-1.2'/&gt;
    &lt;fbc:fluxBound fbc:id='R3b' fbc:reaction='R3' fbc:operation='greaterEqual' fbc:value='-INF'/&gt;

&lt;/fbc:listOfFluxBounds&gt;
</pre>
 <p>
 * @note This class is only defined for Version&nbsp;1 of the
 * &ldquo;fbc&rdquo; package specification.  It was replaced in
 * Version&nbsp;2 by a {@link Parameter} referenced by the 'upperFluxBound' or
 * 'lowerFluxBound' attributes on an {@link FbcReactionPlugin}.  {@link FluxBound} is
 * therefore not used for Version&nbsp;2 &ldquo;fbc&rdquo; models.

 <p>
 * Users need to be aware of some important API issues that are the result of
 * the history of SBML and libSBML.  Prior to SBML Level&nbsp;3
 * Version&nbsp;2, SBML defined 'id' and 'name' attributes on only a subset
 * of SBML objects.  To simplify the work of programmers, libSBML's API
 * provided get, set, check, and unset on the {@link SBase} object class itself
 * instead of on individual subobject classes. This made the
 * get/set/etc. methods uniformly available on all objects in the libSBML
 * API.  LibSBML simply returned empty strings or otherwise did not act when
 * the methods were applied to SBML objects that were not defined by the SBML
 * specification to have 'id' or 'name' attributes.  Additional complications
 * arose with the rule and assignment objects: {@link InitialAssignment},
 * {@link EventAssignment}, {@link AssignmentRule}, and {@link RateRule}.  In early versions of SBML,
 * the rule object hierarchy was different, and in addition, then as now,
 * they possess different attributes: 'variable' (for the rules and event
 * assignments), 'symbol' (for initial assignments), or neither (for
 * algebraic rules).  Prior to SBML Level&nbsp;3 Version&nbsp;2, getId()
 * would always return an empty string, and isSetId() would always return 
 * <code>false</code> for objects of these classes.
 <p>
 * With the addition of 'id' and 'name' attributes on {@link SBase} in Level&nbsp;3
 * Version&nbsp;2, it became necessary to introduce a new way to interact
 * with the attributes more consistently in libSBML to avoid breaking
 * backward compatibility in the behavior of the original 'id' methods.  For
 * this reason, libSBML provides four functions (getIdAttribute(),
 * setIdAttribute(String), isSetIdAttribute(), and
 * unsetIdAttribute()) that always act on the actual 'id' attribute inherited
 * from {@link SBase}, regardless of the object's type.  <strong>These new methods
 * should be used instead of the older getId()/setId()/etc. methods</strong>
 * unless the old behavior is somehow necessary.  Regardless of the Level and
 * Version of the SBML, these functions allow client applications to use more
 * generalized code in some situations (for instance, when manipulating
 * objects that are all known to have identifiers).  If the object in
 * question does not posess an 'id' attribute according to the SBML
 * specification for the Level and Version in use, libSBML will not allow the
 * identifier to be set, nor will it read or write 'id' attributes for those
 * objects.
 <p>
 * <p>
 * @return integer value indicating success/failure of the
 * function.   The possible values

 * <p>
 * In SBML Level&nbsp;3 Version&nbsp;2, the 'id' and 'name' attributes were
 * moved to {@link SBase} directly, instead of being defined individually for many

 * defined on {@link SBase} itself to get, set, and unset those attributes, which 
 * would fail or otherwise return empty strings if executed on any object 
 * for which those attributes were not defined.  Now that all {@link SBase} objects 
 * define those attributes, those functions now succeed for any object with 
 * the appropriate level and version.
 <p>
 * The 'name' attribute is
 * optional and is not intended to be used for cross-referencing purposes
 * within a model.  Its purpose instead is to provide a human-readable
 * label for the component.  The data type of 'name' is the type
 * <code>string</code> defined in XML Schema.  SBML imposes no
 * restrictions as to the content of 'name' attributes beyond those
 * restrictions defined by the <code>string</code> type in XML Schema.
 <p>
 * The recommended practice for handling 'name' is as follows.  If a
 * software tool has the capability for displaying the content of 'name'
 * attributes, it should display this content to the user as a
 * component's label instead of the component's 'id'.  If the user
 * interface does not have this capability (e.g., because it cannot
 * display or use special characters in symbol names), or if the 'name'
 * attribute is missing on a given component, then the user interface
 * should display the value of the 'id' attribute instead.  (Script
 * language interpreters are especially likely to display 'id' instead of
 * 'name'.)
 <p>
 * As a consequence of the above, authors of systems that automatically
 * generate the values of 'id' attributes should be aware some systems
 * may display the 'id''s to the user.  Authors therefore may wish to
 * take some care to have their software create 'id' values that are: (a)
 * reasonably easy for humans to type and read; and (b) likely to be
 * meaningful, for example by making the 'id' attribute be an abbreviated
 * form of the name attribute value.
 <p>
 * An additional point worth mentioning is although there are
 * restrictions on the uniqueness of 'id' values, there are no
 * restrictions on the uniqueness of 'name' values in a model.  This
 * allows software applications leeway in assigning component identifiers.

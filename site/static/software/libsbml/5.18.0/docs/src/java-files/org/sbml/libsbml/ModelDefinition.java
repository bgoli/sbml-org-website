/**

 A model used in model composition.
 <p>
 * The <a href='../../../extensions-summary.html#comp'>Hierarchical Model Composition</a> (&ldquo;comp&rdquo;) package allows multiple {@link Model} objects
 * to be defined in a single {@link SBMLDocument}.  While these new {@link Model} objects are
 * not new SBML classes, they are given a new name,
 * <code>&lt;modelDefinition&gt;</code>, and reside in ListOfModelDefinition
 * objects.  In libSBML, this class inherits from the {@link Model} class, changing
 * only the expected parent of the object, and the XML name.
 <p>
 * An additional restriction is placed on the 'id' attribute of {@link ModelDefinition}
 * objects:  not only must it be unique across all such attributes of type SId 
 * within the ModelDefintion, it must also be unique across all {@link Model}, 
 * {@link ModelDefinition}, and {@link ExternalModelDefinition} objects in the same {@link SBMLDocument}.

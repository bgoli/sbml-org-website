 Extension of {@link MultiSpeciesType} to define a binding site.
 <p>
 * A {@link BindingSiteSpeciesType} inherits from {@link MultiSpeciesType}, and also is a
 * child of the extended {@link Model} (via the {@link MultiModelPlugin}). A
 * {@link BindingSiteSpeciesType} object defines a binding site, and therefore its
 * instance can further define the bindingStatus attribute and can
 * participate a binding internally and explicitly in an {@link InSpeciesTypeBond}
 * object, or externally and implicitly defined by an {@link OutwardBindingSite}
 * object. A binding site must be an atomic component which means that a
 * {@link BindingSiteSpeciesType} object cannot contain a {@link ListOfSpeciesTypeInstances}
 * subobject. Note: In the Multi package, a binding site can only participate
 * in one binding at a time. That means a binding site cannot bind two
 * partners at the same time. The binding relationship is one-to-one.

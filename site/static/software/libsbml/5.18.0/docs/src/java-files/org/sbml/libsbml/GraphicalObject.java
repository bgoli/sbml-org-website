 Base class of objects that store layouts.
 <p>
 * All the more specific layout elements (CompartmentGlyph, {@link GeneralGlyph},
 * {@link SpeciesGlyph}, {@link ReactionGlyph}, {@link ReferenceGlyph}, {@link TextGlyph}, and
 * {@link SpeciesReferenceGlyph}) are derived from the class {@link GraphicalObject}. Each
 * object of class {@link GraphicalObject} has a mandatory {@link BoundingBox}, which
 * specifies the position and the size of the object.  While {@link GraphicalObject}
 * is the base class for most elements in the &ldquo;layout&rdquo; package,
 * it is not an abstract class. It can be instantiated when used in the
 * listOfAdditionalGraphicalObjects to describe additional elements and
 * relationships. Since it only describes a {@link BoundingBox}, programs are
 * encouraged to add Annotation objects that describe program-specific
 * graphical information.

 * is used to identify the object within the SBML model definition.
 * Other objects can refer to the component using this identifier.  The
 * data type of 'id' is always <code>SId</code> or a type derived
 * from that, such as <code>UnitSId</code>, depending on the object in 
 * question.  All data types are defined as follows:
 * <pre style='margin-left: 2em; border: none; font-weight: bold; color: black'>
 *   letter .= 'a'..'z','A'..'Z'
 *   digit  .= '0'..'9'
 *   idChar .= letter | digit | '_'
 *   SId    .= ( letter | '_' ) idChar*
 * </pre>
 * The characters <code>(</code> and <code>)</code> are used for grouping,
 * the character <code>*</code> 'zero or more times', and the character
 * <code>|</code> indicates logical 'or'.  The equality of SBML identifiers
 * is determined by an exact character sequence match; i.e., comparisons must
 * be performed in a case-sensitive manner.  This applies to all uses of
 * <code>SId</code>, <code>SIdRef</code>, and derived types.
 <p>
 * Users need to be aware of some important API issues that are the result of
 * the history of SBML and libSBML.  Prior to SBML Level&nbsp;3
 * Version&nbsp;2, SBML defined 'id' and 'name' attributes on only a subset
 * of SBML objects.  To simplify the work of programmers, libSBML's API
 * provided get, set, check, and unset on the {@link SBase} object class itself
 * instead of on individual subobject classes. This made the
 * get/set/etc. methods uniformly available on all objects in the libSBML
 * API.  LibSBML simply returned empty strings or otherwise did not act when
 * the methods were applied to SBML objects that were not defined by the SBML
 * specification to have 'id' or 'name' attributes.  Additional complications
 * arose with the rule and assignment objects: {@link InitialAssignment},
 * {@link EventAssignment}, {@link AssignmentRule}, and {@link RateRule}.  In early versions of SBML,
 * the rule object hierarchy was different, and in addition, then as now,
 * they possess different attributes: 'variable' (for the rules and event
 * assignments), 'symbol' (for initial assignments), or neither (for
 * algebraic rules).  Prior to SBML Level&nbsp;3 Version&nbsp;2, getId()
 * would always return an empty string, and isSetId() would always return 
 * <code>false</code> for objects of these classes.
 <p>
 * With the addition of 'id' and 'name' attributes on {@link SBase} in Level&nbsp;3
 * Version&nbsp;2, it became necessary to introduce a new way to interact
 * with the attributes more consistently in libSBML to avoid breaking
 * backward compatibility in the behavior of the original 'id' methods.  For
 * this reason, libSBML provides four functions (getIdAttribute(),
 * setIdAttribute(String), isSetIdAttribute(), and
 * unsetIdAttribute()) that always act on the actual 'id' attribute inherited
 * from {@link SBase}, regardless of the object's type.  <strong>These new methods
 * should be used instead of the older getId()/setId()/etc. methods</strong>
 * unless the old behavior is somehow necessary.  Regardless of the Level and
 * Version of the SBML, these functions allow client applications to use more
 * generalized code in some situations (for instance, when manipulating
 * objects that are all known to have identifiers).  If the object in
 * question does not posess an 'id' attribute according to the SBML
 * specification for the Level and Version in use, libSBML will not allow the
 * identifier to be set, nor will it read or write 'id' attributes for those
 * objects.

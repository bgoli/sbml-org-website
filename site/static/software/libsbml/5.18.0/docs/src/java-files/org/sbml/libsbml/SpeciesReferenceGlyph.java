 A glyph for an SBML <em>species reference</em>.
 <p>
 * The SpeciesReferenceGlyph element describes the graphical connection
 * between a {@link SpeciesGlyph} and a {@link ReactionGlyph} (which would be an arrow or
 * some curve in most cases). A {@link SpeciesReferenceGlyph} inherits from
 * {@link GraphicalObject}, and adds a mandatory attribute 'speciesGlyph' and two
 * optional attributes 'speciesReference' and 'role'. Optionally, the
 * {@link SpeciesReferenceGlyph} also has a child element 'curve'.
 <p>
 * If the curve is specified, it overrides the inherited bounding box.

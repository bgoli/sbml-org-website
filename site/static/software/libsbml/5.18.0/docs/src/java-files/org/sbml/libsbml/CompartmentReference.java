 Child of a {@link Compartment} that references a different {@link Compartment}.
 <p>

 * reference another {@link Compartment}, and indicates that the referenced
 * {@link Compartment} is a sub-compartment in a composite parent compartment.
 * Compartments may be arbitrarily nested in this way, but this nesting
 * cannot be circular.

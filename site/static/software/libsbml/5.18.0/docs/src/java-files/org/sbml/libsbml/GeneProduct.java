 {@link Association} of a gene product with a {@link Reaction}
 <p>
 * In the SBML Level&nbsp;3 <a href='../../../extensions-summary.html#fbc'>Flux Balance Constraints</a> (&ldquo;fbc&rdquo;) package
 * representation format, a {@link GeneProduct} object represents a single gene or
 * implied gene product.  The gene or gene product is identified using the
 * required attribute 'label', which is a text string.  (This attribute is
 * separate from the usual SBML 'id' attribute, which is used to
 * cross-reference entities within an SBML model.)  A {@link GeneProduct} object can
 * also possess an optional 'associatedSpecies' attribute; if this a
 * attribute is defined, it should have a value of type <code>SIdRef</code>
 * and be the identifier of a {@link Species} object defined in the enclosing {@link Model}.
 * An 'associatedSpecies', if it exists, is interpreted to be a species
 * associated with the gene or gene product that is represented by the
 * {@link GeneProduct} object.
 <p>
 * <p>
 * @note This class of objects was introduced in Version&nbsp;2 of the
 * SBML Level&nbsp;3 Flux Balance Constraints (&ldquo;fbc&rdquo;)
 * specification.  In Version&nbsp;1 of &ldquo;fbc&rdquo;, the information
 * encoded by this class can be stored instead using the {@link Association} and
 * {@link GeneAssociation} annotation classes.  Please see the Version&nbsp;1 and
 * Version&nbsp;2 &ldquo;fbc&rdquo; specifications for more details.

 * The identifier given by an object's 'id' attribute value

 * <pre style='margin-left: 2em; border: none; font-weight: bold; color: black'>
 *   letter .= 'a'..'z','A'..'Z'
 *   digit  .= '0'..'9'
 *   idChar .= letter | digit | '_'
 *   SId    .= ( letter | '_' ) idChar*
 * </pre>
 * The characters <code>(</code> and <code>)</code> are used for grouping,
 * the character <code>*</code> 'zero or more times', and the character
 * <code>|</code> indicates logical 'or'.  The equality of SBML identifiers
 * is determined by an exact character sequence match; i.e., comparisons must
 * be performed in a case-sensitive manner.  This applies to all uses of
 * <code>SId</code>, <code>SIdRef</code>, and derived types.
 <p>
 * Users need to be aware of some important API issues that are the result of
 * the history of SBML and libSBML.  Prior to SBML Level&nbsp;3
 * Version&nbsp;2, SBML defined 'id' and 'name' attributes on only a subset
 * of SBML objects.  To simplify the work of programmers, libSBML's API
 * provided get, set, check, and unset on the {@link SBase} object class itself
 * instead of on individual subobject classes. This made the
 * get/set/etc. methods uniformly available on all objects in the libSBML
 * API.  LibSBML simply returned empty strings or otherwise did not act when
 * the methods were applied to SBML objects that were not defined by the SBML
 * specification to have 'id' or 'name' attributes.  Additional complications
 * arose with the rule and assignment objects: {@link InitialAssignment},
 * {@link EventAssignment}, {@link AssignmentRule}, and {@link RateRule}.  In early versions of SBML,
 * the rule object hierarchy was different, and in addition, then as now,
 * they possess different attributes: 'variable' (for the rules and event
 * assignments), 'symbol' (for initial assignments), or neither (for
 * algebraic rules).  Prior to SBML Level&nbsp;3 Version&nbsp;2, getId()
 * would always return an empty string, and isSetId() would always return 
 * <code>false</code> for objects of these classes.
 <p>
 * With the addition of 'id' and 'name' attributes on {@link SBase} in Level&nbsp;3
 * Version&nbsp;2, it became necessary to introduce a new way to interact
 * with the attributes more consistently in libSBML to avoid breaking
 * backward compatibility in the behavior of the original 'id' methods.  For
 * this reason, libSBML provides four functions (getIdAttribute(),
 * setIdAttribute(String), isSetIdAttribute(), and
 * unsetIdAttribute()) that always act on the actual 'id' attribute inherited
 * from {@link SBase}, regardless of the object's type.  <strong>These new methods
 * should be used instead of the older getId()/setId()/etc. methods</strong>
 * unless the old behavior is somehow necessary.  Regardless of the Level and
 * Version of the SBML, these functions allow client applications to use more
 * generalized code in some situations (for instance, when manipulating
 * objects that are all known to have identifiers).  If the object in
 * question does not posess an 'id' attribute according to the SBML
 * specification for the Level and Version in use, libSBML will not allow the
 * identifier to be set, nor will it read or write 'id' attributes for those
 * objects.

   * <p>
 * <p>
 * In SBML Level&nbsp;3 Version&nbsp;2, the 'id' and 'name' attributes were
 * moved to {@link SBase} directly, instead of being defined individually for many
 * (but not all) objects.  LibSBML has for a long time provided functions
 * defined on {@link SBase} itself to get, set, and unset those attributes, which 
 * would fail or otherwise return empty strings if executed on any object 
 * for which those attributes were not defined.  Now that all {@link SBase} objects 
 * define those attributes, those functions now succeed for any object with 
 * the appropriate level and version.
 <p>
 * The 'name' attribute is
 * optional and is not intended to be used for cross-referencing purposes
 * within a model.  Its purpose instead is to provide a human-readable
 * label for the component.  The data type of 'name' is the type
 * <code>string</code> defined in XML Schema.  SBML imposes no
 * restrictions as to the content of 'name' attributes beyond those
 * restrictions defined by the <code>string</code> type in XML Schema.
 <p>
 * The recommended practice for handling 'name' is as follows.  If a
 * software tool has the capability for displaying the content of 'name'
 * attributes, it should display this content to the user as a
 * component's label instead of the component's 'id'.  If the user
 * interface does not have this capability (e.g., because it cannot
 * display or use special characters in symbol names), or if the 'name'
 * attribute is missing on a given component, then the user interface
 * should display the value of the 'id' attribute instead.  (Script
 * language interpreters are especially likely to display 'id' instead of
 * 'name'.)
 <p>
 * As a consequence of the above, authors of systems that automatically
 * generate the values of 'id' attributes should be aware some systems
 * may display the 'id''s to the user.  Authors therefore may wish to
 * take some care to have their software create 'id' values that are: (a)
 * reasonably easy for humans to type and read; and (b) likely to be
 * meaningful, for example by making the 'id' attribute be an abbreviated
 * form of the name attribute value.
 <p>
 * An additional point worth mentioning is although there are

 * restrictions on the uniqueness of 'name' values in a model.  This

/**
   * Unsets the value of the 'name' attribute of this {@link GeneProduct}.
   <p>
   * <p>
 * <p>
 * In SBML Level&nbsp;3 Version&nbsp;2, the 'id' and 'name' attributes were
 * moved to {@link SBase} directly, instead of being defined individually for many
 * (but not all) objects.  LibSBML has for a long time provided functions
 * defined on {@link SBase} itself to get, set, and unset those attributes, which 
 * would fail or otherwise return empty strings if executed on any object 
 * for which those attributes were not defined.  Now that all {@link SBase} objects 
 * define those attributes, those functions now succeed for any object with 
 * the appropriate level and version.
 <p>
 * The 'name' attribute is
 * optional and is not intended to be used for cross-referencing purposes
 * within a model.  Its purpose instead is to provide a human-readable
 * label for the component.  The data type of 'name' is the type
 * <code>string</code> defined in XML Schema.  SBML imposes no
 * restrictions as to the content of 'name' attributes beyond those
 * restrictions defined by the <code>string</code> type in XML Schema.
 <p>
 * The recommended practice for handling 'name' is as follows.  If a
 * software tool has the capability for displaying the content of 'name'
 * attributes, it should display this content to the user as a
 * component's label instead of the component's 'id'.  If the user
 * interface does not have this capability (e.g., because it cannot
 * display or use special characters in symbol names), or if the 'name'
 * attribute is missing on a given component, then the user interface
 * should display the value of the 'id' attribute instead.  (Script
 * language interpreters are especially likely to display 'id' instead of
 * 'name'.)
 <p>
 * As a consequence of the above, authors of systems that automatically
 * generate the values of 'id' attributes should be aware some systems
 * may display the 'id''s to the user.  Authors therefore may wish to
 * take some care to have their software create 'id' values that are: (a)
 * reasonably easy for humans to type and read; and (b) likely to be
 * meaningful, for example by making the 'id' attribute be an abbreviated
 * form of the name attribute value.
 <p>
 * An additional point worth mentioning is although there are
 * restrictions on the uniqueness of 'id' values, there are no
 * restrictions on the uniqueness of 'name' values in a model.  This
 * allows software applications leeway in assigning component identifiers.
 <p>
 * Regardless of the level and version of the SBML, these functions allow
 * client applications to use more generalized code in some situations 
 * (for instance, when manipulating objects that are all known to have 
 * names).  If the object in question does not posess a 'name' attribute

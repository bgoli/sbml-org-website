/** 
 * <span class="pkg-marker pkg-color-multi"><a href="group__multi.html">multi</a></span>
 A subclass of {@link Reaction} for changes of an internal species bond.
 <p>
 * An {@link IntraSpeciesReaction} is derived from {@link Reaction} for the reactions
 * happening within a {@link Species}. A particular {@link Reaction} may happen within a
 * {@link Species} as an {@link IntraSpeciesReaction} if the following conditions are
 * fulfilled:
 <p>
 * <ul>
 * <li> The {@link Reaction} is either an association reaction or a dissociation
 * reaction.
 <p>
 * <li> If it is an association reaction, each of the two reactant {@link Species} has
 * at least one {@link OutwardBindingSite} free ('unbound').
 <p>
 * <li> If it is a dissociation reaction, each of the two product {@link Species} has
 * at least one {@link OutwardBindingSite} free ('unbound').
 *
 * </ul> <p>
 * Note: Technically, transformations are also reactions happening with one
 * {@link Species}, but they do not have the ambiguity of association and
 * dissociation reactions. Therefore, a transformation reaction does not have
 * to be defined as an {@link IntraSpeciesReaction}.

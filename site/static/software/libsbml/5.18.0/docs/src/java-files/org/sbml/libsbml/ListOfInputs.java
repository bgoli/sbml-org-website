 A list of {@link Input} objects.
 <p>
 * The {@link ListOfInputs} is a container for the Inputs of a {@link Transition}.
 <p>
 * <p>
 * The various ListOf___ classes in SBML
 * are merely containers used for organizing the main components of an SBML
 * model.  In libSBML's implementation, ListOf___
 * classes are derived from the
 * intermediate utility class {@link ListOf}, which
 * is not defined by the SBML specifications but serves as a useful
 * programmatic construct.  {@link ListOf} is itself is in turn derived from {@link SBase},
 * which provides all of the various ListOf___
 * classes with common features
 * defined by the SBML specification, such as 'metaid' attributes and
 * annotations.
 <p>
 * The relationship between the lists and the rest of an SBML model is
 * illustrated by the following (for SBML Level&nbsp;2 Version&nbsp;4):
 <p>
 * <figure>
  <object type="image/svg+xml" data="listof-illustration.svg" class="centered"></object>
</figure>

 <p>
 * SBML Level&nbsp;3 Version&nbsp;1 has essentially the same structure as 
 * Level&nbsp;2 Version&nbsp;4, depicted above, but SBML Level&nbsp;3 
 * Version&nbsp;2 allows
 * containers to contain zero or more of the relevant object, instead of 
 * requiring at least one.  As such, libsbml will write out an 
 * otherwise-empty ListOf___ element that has any optional attribute set 
 * (such as 'id' or 'metaid'), that has an optional child (such 
 * as a 'notes' or 'annotation'), or that has attributes or children set
 * from any SBML Level&nbsp;3 package, whether or not the ListOf___ has 
 * any other children.
 <p>
 * Readers may wonder about the motivations for using the ListOf___
 * containers in SBML.  A simpler approach in XML might be to place the
 * components all directly at the top level of the model definition.  The
 * choice made in SBML is to group them within XML elements named after
 * ListOf<em>Classname</em>, in part because it helps organize the
 * components.  More importantly, the fact that the container classes are
 * derived from {@link SBase} means that software tools can add information <em>about</em>
 * the lists themselves into each list container's 'annotation'.

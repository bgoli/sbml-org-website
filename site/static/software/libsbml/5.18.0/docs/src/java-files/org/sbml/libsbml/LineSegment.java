 Representation of a line.
 <p>
 * The {@link LineSegment} class consists of the mandatory attribute xsi:type and two
 * child elements of type {@link Point}. One is called 'start' and represents the
 * starting point of the line, the other is called 'end' and represents the
 * endpoint of the line.  The {@link LineSegment} class is also the base class for
 * {@link CubicBezier}, which represent curved lines instead of straight ones.

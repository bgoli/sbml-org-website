/** 
 * <span class="pkg-marker pkg-color-comp"><a href="group__comp.html">comp</a></span>
 An interface to be used in composition.
 <p>
 * The {@link Port} class was introduced by the SBML Level&nbsp;3 <a href='../../../extensions-summary.html#comp'>Hierarchical Model Composition</a>
 * (&ldquo;comp&rdquo;) package to allow a {@link Model} to define a standard
 * interface between it and other models that might use it as a submodel.  It
 * derives from the {@link SBaseRef} class, and the elements defined there refer to
 * elements in the same parent {@link Model} as the {@link Port} object.  A {@link Port} object
 * instance therefore uses those attributes to define a port for a component
 * in a model.  When other {@link SBaseRef} or {@link SBaseRef}-derived classes refer to a
 * {@link Port} object using a 'portRef' attribute, the element being referenced is
 * the element the {@link Port} object itself points to.
 <p>
 * In the present formulation of the Hierarchical Model Composition
 * package, the use of ports is not enforced, nor is there any
 * mechanism to restrict which ports may be used in what ways&mdash;they are
 * only an advisory construct.  Future versions of this SBML package may
 * provide additional functionality to support explicit restrictions on
 * port use.  For the present definition of Hierarchical Model Composition,
 * users of models containing ports are encouraged to respect the modeler's
 * intention in defining ports, and use the port definitions to interact
 * with components through their ports (when they have ports defined)
 * rather than interact directly with the components.
 <p>
 * The required attribute 'id' is used to give an identifier to a
 * {@link Port} object so that other objects can refer to it.  The attribute has
 * type PortSId and is essentially identical to the SBML
 * primitive type SId, except that its namespace is limited to
 * the identifiers of {@link Port} objects defined within a {@link Model} object.  In
 * parallel, the PortSId type has a companion type,
 * PortSIdRef, that corresponds to the SBML primitive type
 * SIdRef; the value space of PortSIdRef is limited
 * to PortSId values.

 * Version&nbsp;2, SBML defined 'id' and 'name' attributes on only a subset

 * provided get, set, check, and unset on the {@link SBase} object class itself
 * instead of on individual subobject classes. This made the
 * get/set/etc. methods uniformly available on all objects in the libSBML
 * API.  LibSBML simply returned empty strings or otherwise did not act when
 * the methods were applied to SBML objects that were not defined by the SBML
 * specification to have 'id' or 'name' attributes.  Additional complications
 * arose with the rule and assignment objects: {@link InitialAssignment},

 * the rule object hierarchy was different, and in addition, then as now,
 * they possess different attributes: 'variable' (for the rules and event
 * assignments), 'symbol' (for initial assignments), or neither (for

 <p>
 * With the addition of 'id' and 'name' attributes on {@link SBase} in Level&nbsp;3

 * define those attributes, those functions now succeed for any object with 
 * the appropriate level and version.
 <p>
 * The 'name' attribute is

 * restrictions defined by the <code>string</code> type in XML Schema.
 <p>
 * The recommended practice for handling 'name' is as follows.  If a
 * software tool has the capability for displaying the content of 'name'
 * attributes, it should display this content to the user as a
 * component's label instead of the component's 'id'.  If the user
 * interface does not have this capability (e.g., because it cannot
 * display or use special characters in symbol names), or if the 'name'
 * attribute is missing on a given component, then the user interface
 * should display the value of the 'id' attribute instead.  (Script
 * language interpreters are especially likely to display 'id' instead of
 * 'name'.)
 <p>
 * As a consequence of the above, authors of systems that automatically
 * generate the values of 'id' attributes should be aware some systems
 * may display the 'id''s to the user.  Authors therefore may wish to
 * take some care to have their software create 'id' values that are: (a)
 * reasonably easy for humans to type and read; and (b) likely to be
 * meaningful, for example by making the 'id' attribute be an abbreviated
 * form of the name attribute value.
 <p>
 * An additional point worth mentioning is although there are
 * restrictions on the uniqueness of 'id' values, there are no
 * restrictions on the uniqueness of 'name' values in a model.  This
 * allows software applications leeway in assigning component identifiers.

 An &ldquo;or&rdquo; relationship for gene products
 <p>
 * {@link FbcOr} class is used in Version 2 of the SBML Level&nbsp;3 <a href='../../../extensions-summary.html#fbc'>Flux Balance Constraints</a>
 * (&ldquo;fbc&rdquo;) package to represent an 'or' relationship between two
 * or more child {@link FbcAssociation} objects.  In other words, it indicates that
 * only one of the child objects are included.  Note that since the
 * {@link FbcAssociation} class is the parent class of {@link GeneProductRef}, {@link FbcAnd}, and
 * {@link FbcOr}, a given {@link FbcOr} can potentially include nested 'and'/'or'
 * combinations of gene products.
 <p>
 * <p>
 * @note This class of objects was introduced in Version&nbsp;2 of the
 * SBML Level&nbsp;3 Flux Balance Constraints (&ldquo;fbc&rdquo;)
 * specification.  In Version&nbsp;1 of &ldquo;fbc&rdquo;, the information
 * encoded by this class can be stored instead using the {@link Association} and
 * {@link GeneAssociation} annotation classes.  Please see the Version&nbsp;1 and
 * Version&nbsp;2 &ldquo;fbc&rdquo; specifications for more details.
 <p>

/** 
 * <span class="pkg-marker pkg-color-comp"><a href="group__comp.html">comp</a></span>
 Deletion of an object from a submodel.
 <p>
 * The {@link Deletion} class was introduced by the SBML Level&nbsp;3 <a href='../../../extensions-summary.html#comp'>Hierarchical Model Composition</a>
 * (&ldquo;comp&rdquo;) package to allow elements of submodels to be removed
 * before instantiation.
<p>
 * The {@link Deletion} object class is used to define a deletion operation
 * to be applied when a submodel instantiates a model definition.
 * Deletions may be useful in hierarchical model composition scenarios for
 * various reasons.  For example, some components in a submodel may be
 * redundant in the composed model, perhaps because the same features are
 * implemented in a different way in the new model.
<p>
 * Deletions function as follows.  When the {@link Model} to which the {@link Submodel}
 * object refers (via the 'modelRef' attribute) is read and processed for
 * inclusion into the composed model, each {@link Deletion} object identifies an
 * object to remove from that {@link Model} instance.  The resulting submodel
 * instance consists of everything in the {@link Model} object instance minus the
 * entities referenced by the list of {@link Deletion} objects.
 <p>
 * As might be expected, deletions can have wide-ranging implications,
 * especially when the object deleted has substantial substructure, as in
 * the case of reactions.  The following are rules regarding deletions and
 * their effects.
 <p>
 * <ul>
 * <li> An object that has been deleted is considered inaccessible.
 * Any element that has been deleted (or replaced)
 * may not be referenced by an {@link SBaseRef} object.
 * <li> If the deleted object has child objects and other structures, the
 * child objects and substructure are also considered to be deleted.
 * <li> It is not an error to delete explicitly an object that is already
 * deleted by implication (for example as a result of the second point
 * above).  The resulting model is the same.
 * <li> If the deleted object is from an SBML namespace that is not
 * understood by the interpreter, the deletion must be ignored&mdash;the 
 * object will not need to be deleted, as the interpreter could not
 * understand the package.  If an interpreter cannot tell whether 
 * a referenced object does not exist or if exists in an unparsed namespace
 * it may produce a warning.
 *
 * </ul> <p>
 * The {@link Deletion} object class is subclassed from {@link SBaseRef}, and reuses all the 
 * machinery provided by {@link SBaseRef}.  In addition, it defines two optional 
 * attributes, 'id' and 'name'.  The 'id' attribute can be used to give an
 * identifier to a given deletion operation.  The identifier has no
 * mathematical meaning, but it may be useful for creating submodels that
 * can be manipulated more directly by other submodels.  (Indeed, it is
 * legitimate for an enclosing model definition to delete a deletion!)
 <p>
 * The optional 'name' attribute is provided on {@link Deletion} for the
 * same reason it is provided on other elements that have identifiers;
 * viz., to provide for the possibility of giving a human-readable name to
 * the object.  The name may be useful in situations when deletions are
 * displayed to modelers.

 <p>

 * arose with the rule and assignment objects: {@link InitialAssignment},
 * {@link EventAssignment}, {@link AssignmentRule}, and {@link RateRule}.  In early versions of SBML,
 * the rule object hierarchy was different, and in addition, then as now,
 * they possess different attributes: 'variable' (for the rules and event
 * assignments), 'symbol' (for initial assignments), or neither (for
 * algebraic rules).  Prior to SBML Level&nbsp;3 Version&nbsp;2, getId()
 * would always return an empty string, and isSetId() would always return 
 * <code>false</code> for objects of these classes.
 <p>
 * With the addition of 'id' and 'name' attributes on {@link SBase} in Level&nbsp;3
 * Version&nbsp;2, it became necessary to introduce a new way to interact
 * with the attributes more consistently in libSBML to avoid breaking
 * backward compatibility in the behavior of the original 'id' methods.  For
 * this reason, libSBML provides four functions (getIdAttribute(),
 * setIdAttribute(String), isSetIdAttribute(), and
 * unsetIdAttribute()) that always act on the actual 'id' attribute inherited
 * from {@link SBase}, regardless of the object's type.  <strong>These new methods
 * should be used instead of the older getId()/setId()/etc. methods</strong>
 * unless the old behavior is somehow necessary.  Regardless of the Level and
 * Version of the SBML, these functions allow client applications to use more
 * generalized code in some situations (for instance, when manipulating
 * objects that are all known to have identifiers).  If the object in
 * question does not posess an 'id' attribute according to the SBML
 * specification for the Level and Version in use, libSBML will not allow the
 * identifier to be set, nor will it read or write 'id' attributes for those
 * objects.

 * the appropriate level and version.
 <p>
 * The 'name' attribute is
 * optional and is not intended to be used for cross-referencing purposes

 * restrictions as to the content of 'name' attributes beyond those
 * restrictions defined by the <code>string</code> type in XML Schema.
 <p>
 * The recommended practice for handling 'name' is as follows.  If a
 * software tool has the capability for displaying the content of 'name'
 * attributes, it should display this content to the user as a
 * component's label instead of the component's 'id'.  If the user
 * interface does not have this capability (e.g., because it cannot

 * attribute is missing on a given component, then the user interface
 * should display the value of the 'id' attribute instead.  (Script
 * language interpreters are especially likely to display 'id' instead of
 * 'name'.)
 <p>
 * As a consequence of the above, authors of systems that automatically
 * generate the values of 'id' attributes should be aware some systems
 * may display the 'id''s to the user.  Authors therefore may wish to
 * take some care to have their software create 'id' values that are: (a)
 * reasonably easy for humans to type and read; and (b) likely to be
 * meaningful, for example by making the 'id' attribute be an abbreviated
 * form of the name attribute value.
 <p>
 * An additional point worth mentioning is although there are
 * restrictions on the uniqueness of 'id' values, there are no
 * restrictions on the uniqueness of 'name' values in a model.  This

Introduction
------------

This is the repository for the completely redesigned SBML.org website, introduced in 2020.  The new site is designed as a static site generated using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) and mostly written in Markdown.  Changes to the site are achieved by editing the files in this git repository and merging the changes into the master branch, whereupon the web server for SBML.org will automatically notice them after a time and update the site pages.


Documentation
-------------

Documentation about this site and the server configuration are kept in the subdirectory [support-docs](support-docs).  Please start with the [README](support-docs/README.md) file in that directory to learn more.

Authors and history
-------------------

The design, organization, look and feel, custom Hugo shortcodes, and many other elements of the site, and much of its content, were created by [Mike Hucka](https://github.com/mhucka) over time during the years 2018&ndash;2020.  The initial starting point was the [Academic](https://github.com/gcushen/hugo-academic) theme for Hugo, but in the end, very little of the theme wound up being present in the visible parts of the site.

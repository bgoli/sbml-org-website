## Description : Simple script to start/stop/restart a Hugo-based server
## Author(s)   : Michael Hucka <mhucka@caltech.edu>
## Organization: California Institute of Technology
## Date created: 2019-03-19
##
## Note: we don't run Hugo as root. To have Hugo bind to port 80 as a non-root
## user, it's necessary to use setcap on the hugo binary (our approach) or
## create a redirection via iptables.  However, that means the hugo binary can't
## write to /var/log and /var/run unless separate subdirectories are precreated.
## In addition, if you run hugo as non-root and you have it write to ../site,
## it needs to have permissions to this directory, so make sure to chown and
## chgrp this entire repository clone on your destination system.
##
## Here's the complete sequence I used on a CentOS 7.6 system, assuming that
## the name of the hugo account is "hugo".
##
##  sudo useradd -M hugo
##  sudo chown -R hugo.hugo ..
##  sudo setcap 'cap_net_bind_service=+ep' /usr/local/bin/hugo
##  sudo mkdir /var/log/hugo /var/run/hugo
##  sudo chown hugo /var/log/hugo /var/run/hugo
##  sudo chgrp hugo /var/log/hugo /var/run/hugo

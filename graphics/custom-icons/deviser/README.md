Modified logo for Deviser
=========================

The original icon file for [Deviser](https://github.com/sbmlteam/deviser) has square proportions and extends to the edges of the image.  This is fine in many situations, but when it's used on web pages next to other logos (e.g., on the [Downloads page of sbml.org](https://sbml.org/downloads)), it looks oversized, because the other logos contain more white space.  In order to make the visual appearance of our pages look more consistent, I added some whitespace to the original Deviser logo.  The modified version of the logo is in this directory.

This is a suboptimal solution, and I wish we could find a better way.
